- 👋 Hi, I’m @VladislavFirsov. i was born 1995 in Saint-petersburg, Russia. Studied as a cinema mechanick as a first degree and at the position on international relations as a
second degree. I was always fond of technology, my excitment grew higher and higher with new information i read but for a huge period in my life i was thinking i'm too stupid 
for that. However, it turned out that i'm not. Also i keen on history, literature, poetry, love reading about space and new discoveries there and also i'm a good table tennis and at footbal.
- 👀 I’m interested in computer sсience and all that related to it, i ,unfortunately, missed these topics in school, was very addicted to MMO games, so i'am trying to get myself up to speed with all that marvellous technologies.
